# 🚀 C++ DSA Basics Repository

Welcome to my **C++ DSA Basics** repository! 👋

This repo contains my journey of learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**. I’m mainly focused on strengthening my problem‑solving foundation for **web development**, so this project includes all the essential concepts without going too deep into advanced C++ (for now 😄).

---

## 📘 What’s Inside

### ✅ **C++ Fundamentals**
- Variables & Data Types
- Input / Output
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays & Pointers
- Basic memory concepts

### 🧩 **Core DSA Implementations**
- Arrays (operations)
- Linked Lists (Singly / basic operations)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Searching Algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- More coming soon...

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo?
I’m learning DSA to support my **web development** skills.  
Even though I’m not mastering advanced C++ right now, I’m using it to build a strong foundation in logic, problem‑solving, and algorithmic thinking. Later, I’ll expand into:
- OOP Concepts
- Recursion-based problems
- More advanced data structures

---

## 🛠️ How to Run These Files
1. Make sure you have a **C++ compiler** installed (e.g., MinGW, GCC, Clang).
2. Compile:
```
g++ filename.cpp -o output
```
3. Run:
```
./output
```

---

## 🌱 Future Plans
- Add OOP (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Add recursion-based problems
- Add graphs, trees, and hashing (later)
- Add practice problems

---

## 💡 Notes
This repo is part of my learning journey. If you’re also starting DSA, feel free to explore the code, give suggestions, or share improvements.

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
